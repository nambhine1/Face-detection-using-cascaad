# Face-detection-using-cascaad

<b> Introduction </b>

Face detection is now become a famous solution in different application such as security application for face recognition and many more, in this tutorial we wouldlike to build an application  program using opencv and carscaad model to detect a face USING PYTHON

<b> motivation </b>

when we wouldlike to build an application of face recognition we have to detect the face first before we can identify the input face, so we should know how to detect face before we can identify the face from the input frame.

<b> technical details </b>

requirement : 

1) - opencv install in conda 

2) - cascaad model download in our computer 

<b> 1)  Install opencv in conda follow the step below </b>: 

open your terminale and activate conda using the following command below:

1-----conda activate

2------conda update conda -c conda-canary

3------conda update conda -c conda-canary

3------pip install opencv-python

<b> 1)  Download cascaad face model using the following link below on github </b>: 

#https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades


After that you can run the source code for face detection attached with this repository
